# Welcome!

I am a second-year PhD student in Economics at the University of Maryland, College Park. I have experience in economic consulting, academic research, advocacy, and international development.

Currently I am working on projects in political economy, public finance, and IO. I am mainly interested in using a combination of reduced-form and structural techniques to conduct policy-oriented empirical research.
