# Welcome!

I am a second-year PhD student in Economics at the University of Maryland, College Park. Currently I am working on projects in political economy, public finance, and IO. I am mainly interested in using a combination of reduced-form and structural techniques to conduct policy-oriented empirical research.

Prior to starting my PhD, I received a B.A. in Economics and Government from Dartmouth College in Hanover, NH, and spent two years as an analyst at Cornerstone Research where supported economics and finance experts in commercial litigation matters such as antitrust investigations. I also have experience as a consultant at the World Bank where I have collaborated with the DaTax lab which studies taxes, firms, and jobs in developing countries using micro data.
